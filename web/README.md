# PurpleSilence project

This is the frontend part of the PurpleSilence app.

## yarn

Use yarn. There is high likelihood that `npm install` won't resolve due to some odd dependency issues. `yarn` provides no such trouble.

## Useful commands

# E2E tests

## Running E2E tests

### Setup env variables for tests

1. Copy example env file: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Populate it with your own values returned by `cloud/scripts/setEnvs.bash` script (`cloud/scripts/setEnvs.ps1` on Windows). 
To run this script you can use the following command `source ./setEnvs.bash` (`./setEnvs.ps1` on Windows)
3. Copy example test env file: `cp .env.test.example .env.test`
4. Populate it with your own values
5. For `AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` copy paste value returned by `cloud/scripts/setEnvs.bash` script
#### Run Cypress tests in the graphical mode:

```
yarn cy:open
```

#### Run all Cypress tests in the headless mode:

```
yarn cy:run
```

## Code coverage

If you want to generate code coverage report after the Cypress tests you should run the server via command:

```
yarn cy:coverage:start
```

and then run the Cypress tests:

```
yarn cy:run
```

The code coverage report will be generated automatically after the test run is finished.

To see the full code coverage report open the `cypress/reports/code-coverage/index.html` file.

To generate the code coverage summary in the terminal after the test run use:
```
yarn nyc report --reporter=text-summary
```

## Mochawesome reporter

If you want to see the mochawesome report you have to generate it manually (when the Cypress tests are finished) using:

```
yarn cy:mocha:generate:report
```

The test reports will **not** be generated automatically after the test run!

To see the mochawesome report open the `cypress/reports/mochawesome/final-report/summary.html` file.

**Attention**: You should remove the report before generating another one. You can do it manually or use a simple command:

```
yarn cy:mocha:clean
```

## Prettier & ESLint

Run Prettier under the `cypress` directory:

```
yarn cy:format
```

Run ESLint under the `cypress` directory:

```
yarn cy:lint
```
